<h1>The Best Movies According to Ruby </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time!</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Madarasapattinam</h3>
<p>This is the best ever soul touching love movie I've ever watched. Visuals of this movie had portrayed that the story had been taken place during the time of India's independence. The story revolves around a foreigner who has a british background and an aspiring photographer. She wanted to capture the beauty of whole Madras which is now renouned as Chennai. She meets a normal poor farmer of a village and asks his help to show her the entire Madras. On the journey, they both fall in love but there they faced a conflict because of their different nationalities. Did they broke the barrier or the barrier broke them? I would rate it 10000/10 as I loved this movie so much!!

<h3>O Kadhal Kanmani</h3>
<p>The most lovable fairytale in the indian cinema. The story revolves around a youngsters who have moved cities for their and working for a successful career of their own. As the female and male leads of the movie meets in an occasion, they smelled a spark between them and became friends. As the female lead have been coping up with her family trauma, she decides not to marry anyone. As the male lead is so focused on his career, he also has no intention of marriage and he thinks that marriage is a stupid thing. But unfortunately, the queen and the king of the movie fall in love with eachother. Will they accept the feelings for eachother and marry? I would rate it 100/10 as it is the most realistic movie I've ever watched!!  </p>
<h3>3</h3>
<p>The most soul crushing beautiful unfinished love story ever. The story revolves around a teenage couple. The male lead who is a 17 year old teenager falls madly in love with a gracious girl who is also a teenager. Both studied in different schools, so, the male lead follows her and joins the tuition center where she also goes. On the journey, she also falls crazily in love with him. But both of their family denies their love. After all the hardles , they finally married to eachother. But there occurs the most horrible incidents(the twist and turns of the movie). I would rate it 1000000000/10 as it made everyone cry and deeply attaches with our emotions!! An incomplete love!! </p>
