<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Myself, Ruby. I am a web developer. In my 11th grade, my parents wanted me to take biology as my major, as they wanted me to become a doctor. But, I didn't have much interest on the medical field as I am the most cheerful and energetic person who always does the things she likes. I am more of a logical and analytical person. I have always excited about the technologies and how the internet works and how the entire IT fiels works. But, I took biology as my major in 11th grade for my parents and in the end of my 12th grade, I told them that I am not interested in the medical field and I want more exciting and peaceful kinda life. So, obviously the next choice is engineering. I took computer science as my major in college. And I have no knowledge about computers and technologies. But, I always had that craving to learn everything and become a good software engineer. I started my coding journey in the 2nd year of my college as it took me the whole first year to analyze what I love in this field and in which way I can get started. And after so much of hardles and  fear, finally I became a good developer. I am fast learner and critical thinker. I've always had the urge of learning new things. In my jouney, as I started late, I had lot of fear as I was behind in learning when compared to my peers. But, as time passes with passion and dedication, I can finally be able to build my first website.Looking forward to more challenges and solutions. Thank you!!</p>   </p>
